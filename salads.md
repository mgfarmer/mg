I used to really enjoy tuna, but lost my taste for it several years ago.  And, as you mentioned, it is probably not an ideal fish for several reasons, both ethically and health-wise.  So I generally stick with SMASH fish for now, or which sardines are my favorite (and [these](https://www.amazon.com/MW-polar-Brisling-Sardines-Smoked/dp/B07FCKZWNL) are my current favorite sardine variety).

My lunch (and often dinner too) salads usually have:

* A smallish handful of some variety of power greens or mixed greens
* Raw nuts, usually walnuts, pecans, and sliced almonds
* Roasted pumpkin seed, just a tablespoon or so
* A dozen or so roasted pistachios.
* Blue cheese or Gorganzola crumbles
* Chunks from half an avocado
* Half a bell pepper cut into small pieces
* Protein (sardines for lunch, something else for dinner (*wife friendly*)
* Salt and pepper
* For seasoning I use, one of:
  * A provincial herb blend
  * Trader Joe's "Everything But The Bagel" seasoning
  * [Furikake Yuzu](https://www.amazon.com/MUSO-Organic-Sesame-Shake-YUZU/dp/B07C42R74W/) (for a distinct Asian flavor profile). (*buy locally if you can, too $$$ on amz*)
* And, of course, a ton of microgreens of whatever variety I have in the fridge at the time.
* For dressing: Champaign vinegar and either Olive Oil (if I have Avocado chunks) or Avocado Oil (if I'm out of Avocados). *My wife prefers balsamic vinegar but it's too sweet for me.  Don't get me wrong though, I love a good balsamic, but I cannot tolerate sugar (or any other refined/process carb) any longer.*

So, yeah, it is a huge meal of a salad. No small salad plate for this, I use full size serving bowls for each person. I've been making these for years. And a few months ago, my wife says "Can you make me one too?", so I did, and she's like "These are the best salads ever!"  Now she wants me to make them for dinner once or twice a week, and for dinner guests (sans sardines, of course!). So they are a big hit around here.
