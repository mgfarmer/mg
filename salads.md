I used to really enjoy tuna, but lost my taste for it several years ago.  And, as we now understand, it is probably not an ideal fish for several reasons, both ethically and health-wise.  So I generally stick with [SMASH fish](https://www.realfoodcarolyn.com/blog/smash-seafood) now, of which sardines are my favorite. [These](https://www.amazon.com/King-Oscar-Sardines-Virgin-3-75-Ounce/dp/B0025UK92C) are my current favorite sardine variety, but I'm always look for different varieties to try (*what are you using?*).

My lunch (and often dinner) salads usually have, in order of assembly:

* A smallish handful of some variety of power greens or mixed greens
* Raw nuts, usually walnuts, pecans, and sliced almonds
* Roasted pumpkin seed, just a tablespoon or so
* A dozen or so roasted pistachios (great salty crunch)
* Blue cheese or Gorganzola crumbles (yummmy mold!)
* Chunks from half an avocado
* Protein (sardines for lunch, something else for dinner
* A ton of microgreens of whatever variety I have in the fridge at the time
* Salt and pepper
* Half a bell pepper cut into small pieces
* For other seasoning I use, one of:
  * A provincial herb blend
  * Trader Joe's "Everything But The Bagel" seasoning
  * [Furikake Yuzu](https://www.amazon.com/MUSO-Organic-Sesame-Shake-YUZU/dp/B07C42R74W/) (for a distinct Asian flavor profile). (*buy locally if you can, too $$$ on amz*)
* For dressing: Champaign vinegar and either Olive Oil (if I have Avocado chunks) or Avocado Oil (if I'm out of Avocados). *Some people will prefers balsamic vinegar but it's too sweet for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love a good balsamic, but I cannot tolerate the sugar (or any other refined/process carb) any longer.*

So, yeah, it is a huge meal of a salad. No small salad plate for this, I use full size serving bowls for each person. I've been making these for years.
