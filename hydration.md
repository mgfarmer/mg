## Hydration Strategy

We live on a small farm property and have a well that provides our water.  The water inside the house (and spigots on the outside walls of the house) go through a water softener.  Most water softeners, ours included, replace hard minerals with salt.  So softened water is really just low concentration salt water.  Plants don't really like this (except maybe Kelp).  We discovered this by observing some our garden and house plants just not thriving in otherwise ideal condition when irrigated with soft water.  So, from the start, I only used un-softened water for the microgreens.  Since we don't have any un-softened water in the house, I need to go outside to one of the property hydrants to get water.  No big deal.  There's one just 10 feet out my office door.  

Fortunately our well water Ph is ideal for growing microgreens. 

Initially I watered by volume.  Add X amount of water twice a day.  But that got me to thinking "how much water do these micros actually use in a day?" So one day I started weighing the tray every hour or two.  I ended up with a chart that looks like:

Usage is a combination of evaporation and consumption.  I did this for a few days and it was very consistent, but increases over time as the greens grow.  When the micros are just getting started they don't consume as much water, and as the micros get bigger they consume more water. So by using weight, I can be very sure and accurate that I'm replacing the water that they consume and not over watering the young ones, or underwatering the more mature ones.

So now I manage hydration by weight, not volume.

That pictures shows less than 3.5Kg because I took it several hours after adding water.  

Since my scale is much smaller than the tray. I use a piece of 1/4 hardboard on my scale so the trays don't bend.  Here's my process:

* I place the hardboard on the scale.
* Turn on the scale, or tare it so the reading is 0.
* Place the grow tray on top of the board.
* Read the total weight on the display (let's say it reads 3.176Kg).
* Mentally compute the difference between 3.500Kg and 3.176Kg.  (That would be 324g.)
* Lift the top tray out of the bottom tray and set aside.
* Note the weight of the empty bottom tray (mine are usually about 140g).
* Add this weight to the 324g, giving 464g.
* Add water to the tray until it read 464g.
* Place the top tray back into the bottom tray.
* The scale should now read very close to 3.5Kg. (And you don't need to be super precise!)
* And I'm done with this tray.

Right now the magic number is 3500g.  This is the weight of the entire tray (tray, medium, plant, and water).  Twice a day (target every 12 hours), I weigh the tray, mentally computer how much water to add to get it back to ~3.5Kg, then add that much water.

The magic 3.5Kg number is just that, magic.  There is no formula to come up with it. I picked it based on subjectively judging adequate moisture levels during several grows.  It takes some experimentation and trial-and-error, but since I settled on that 3.5Kg number, I haven't had to changed it, my medium stays nice and moist, but not too moist, and my grows have been excellent, and mold has been banished!  If you choose to water by weight, 3.5Kg might be a good starting point.  You may need to adjust it though.
