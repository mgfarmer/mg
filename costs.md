## Cost Per Tray

This page aims to capture my best estimate of the on-going costs to grow each microgreens tray.  My estimates assume that I'm growing four trays on each shelf.  That is not always true.  Sometimes I grow fewer trays.  Fewer trays will inch up the costs a tiny bit, but as you'll see.  It cost so little to grow microgreens at this scale (personal, friends/family) that it is not worth worrying about.

### Electricity

I use my Kill-a-watt Meter to monitor [power](power.md) use.

Electricity Rate: $0.1213/kWh

Electricity usage pays for Water (well pump), Fans, and Lights.  All I need to know is the power consumption of each of these on a per/tray basis.  The fans and lights are simple to monitor using the Kill-a-watt meter.  The well pump is not so simple.  In fact I have no idea how much the well pump contributes to my monthly power bill.  

### Water Costs

But it is safe to say that the water used to grow a tray is practically zero compared to our total water usage each month.  So I'll call it $0.01/tray (which might be too much).

### Lighting Cost

I light my trays for 16 hours each day.  Each shelf holds 4 trays.  Each shelf draws 83 watts.  Let's say the average tray takes 10 days. So:

((10 days) x (16 hours) x (83 watts)) / (4 tray) = 3320 watt-hours per tray

Or 3.32 kWh/tray.  Multiplied by my average KWh rate of $0.1213:

$0.1213 * 3.32 kWh/tray = $0.40 / tray

### Fan Costs

I run my fans 24/7 while growing.  The fans draw 15 watts per shelf.  Using the 10 day average grow period:

((15 watts) x (24 hours) x (10 days)) / (4 trays) = 900 Wh per tray.

Multiplied by my average KWh rate of $0.1213:

$0.1213 * 0.900 kWh/tray = $0.11 / tray

### Grow Medium Cost

Each 1.5 CF bag of Organic Potting Soil costs me $9.99.  I get about 8 trays from each bag.  That computes to $1.24/tray.

### Seed Costs

The cost for 1lb of seed for most of my favorite varieties averages about $20.  And the quantity per tray is typically 1oz.  So that is 16 trays per $20 spent.

($20.00) / (16 trays) = $0.80/tray

### Total Cost Per Tray Summary

Element | Cost/Tray
--- | ---:
Medium Cost | $1.24
Seed Cost | $0.80
Lighting Power | $0.40
Fan Power | $0.11
Water Usage | $0.01
**Total** | **$2.56**

That's quite a bargain!

Labor cost is zero for us hobby growers, but a significant factor for business growers.
