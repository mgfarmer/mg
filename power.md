## Power Consumption

I use my Kill-a-watt Meter to monitor power use.  I do this more out of curiosity than anything else.

Device | Power Consumption | Notes
----| ---- | ----
Fans | 30 watts (15 watts/shelf) | Fans stay on 24/7 while growing.
Lights | 173 watts (83 watts/shelf) | My current lighting cycle is 16 hours on, 8 hours off.
