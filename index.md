## Welcome!

Welcome to my microgreens site.  This is an ever evolving site that captures my current microgreen's experiences and operations.  I've been at this since about September 2020.  I am by no means an expert, but I've been very successful so far.  I grow strictly for personal consumption and to sell/give-away my neighbors and friends.  At this point I have no intention of scaling up my operation to be a business  Why not, you ask?  This is a hobby for me. Keeps it fun. I have a great full-time WFH job that I'm very happy with (31 years as a software developer and still going...)

This page is constructed using github pages.  It is completely open-sourced.  If you would like to build your own webpage for your operation feel free [fork this repo](https://github.com/mgfarmer/mg) and use it as a starting point. 

If you have comments, questions, or suggestion about growing microgreens, or about this site, you can contact me at mgfarmer@laddhillfarm.com or [iamashaman](https://www.reddit.com/user/iamashaman) on reddit.
