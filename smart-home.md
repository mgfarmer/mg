## SmartHome Integration

Once you start playing with "SmartHome" technology, you quickly realize what an oxymoron the term is.  But it is still fun to play around with. 

I play around with smarthome automation using Google Assistant and Samsung SmartThings.  While building up my Microgreens growing system I decided that I'd integrate it into my "smarthome".  Now I can control my grow lights and fans easily.  I have two grow shelves, and the lights and fans can be independently controlled on each shelf.  The lighting schedule is preprogrammed using SmartThings so the lights turn on and off everyday automatically (unless I disable the schedule because a shelf is not needed at the time).  I can also control everything from my phone, my desktop computer, or my stream deck.  

Of course I can also just use the power switches on all the devices if I want, but they're all out of sight and hard to get to.

I may expand on this stuff later...
