## Photographing Microgreens
Sure, easy enough. Point a camera and take a picture! And that's mostly what I'm doing.  

But between natural light (from Windows), normal room lighting (LED), and grow lights (weird LEDs) camera don't stand chance of capturing an accurate white balance (because all the light sources have different white balances).  So pictures on this page taken with the grow lights on look strange.  The human eye, and brain, is amazingly adept at making everything look "normal", the cameras, not so much.  So please pardon the "off color" images.
