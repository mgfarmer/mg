## My Seeds
These are all the seeds I've grown, am growing, or will grow soon.  I have, or have had, stock of everything in this list.  The only suppliers I've used are [True Leaf Market](https://www.trueleafmarket.com/) and [Rainbow Heirloom Seed Co.](https://www.rainbowheirloomseeds.com/). RHS also sells via Amazon.

Seed | Grow Notes | Notes
---- | ---- | ----
[Sulforaphane Mix](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081TWMLQC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B081TWMLQC&linkCode=as2&tag=mgfarmer-20&linkId=e6d349347598f3f9ca97205e07e812a6) | | One of my favorites. Mild flavor profile. Easy to grow.  Maybe taking microgreen health [to the next level](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6815645/).
[Spicy Salad Mix](https://www.trueleafmarket.com/collections/micro-greens-planting-seed/products/spicy-salad-mix-seed?variant=38827801928) | | Another favorite. Medium Spicy. Easy to grow.
[Colorful Radish Mix](https://www.trueleafmarket.com/products/colorful-radish-microgreens-seed-mix?variant=31827290685555) | | Good radish mix. Quick to grow.

[Bussels Sprouts - Long Island](https://www.trueleafmarket.com/account/orders/10d413bc9e2f71814a45e815227e1d2a) | | Tasty if you 'em.  Can be finicky for me to grow. Still tuning.

My staples are the Sulforaphane Mix from RHS and the Spicy Salad Mix from TLM.  But I'm always cycling through the rest, except the chard and beets which still baffle me.
