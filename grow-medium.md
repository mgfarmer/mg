## Growing Medium

I use [organic potting soil](https://www.farmstore.com/product/1-5-cu-ft-organic-wilco-potting-soil/) sourced from my local farm store (Wilco).  It works well for me.  I get about 10 trays out of one bag of soil.  I keep the soil in a small [galvanized can](https://www.farmstore.com/product/galvanized-steel-trash-can-31-gal).

I've never tried anything other growing medium.  I have no reason to switch.

Many growers use [coco-coir](https://www.amazon.com/Plantonix-Coco-listed-Organic-Bricks/dp/B01N1YP8O6).  I have not, and cannot comment on it.
